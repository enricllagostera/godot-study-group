# Godot study group

More information about each project / study session can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/enricllagostera/godot-study-group/wiki).

### Practical things

The study group meetings will take place on Wednesdays from 2-4pm at the TAG Lab on Concordia University, rtarting on Feb 27. Initially, the meetings are open to TAG members, but if you would like to attend and are not a TAG member, let me know (email: enricllagostera@gmailcom). This could definitely change depending on what participants want too.
